        title: 'What is menstruation?',
        content: `Menstruation is the technical term for getting your period. About once a month, females who have gone through puberty will experience menstrual bleeding. This happens because the lining of the uterus has prepared itself for a possible pregnancy by becoming thicker and richer in blood vessels. If pregnancy does not occur, this thickened lining is shed, accompanied by bleeding. Bleeding usually lasts for 3-8 days. For most women, menstruation happens in a fairly regular, predictable pattern. The length of time from the first day of one period to the first day of the next period normally ranges from 21-35 days.`,

        title: 'What is the menstrual cycle?',
        content: `The menstrual cycle is the monthly hormonal cycle a female's body goes through to prepare for pregnancy. Your menstrual cycle is counted from the first day of your period up to the first day of your next period. Your hormone levels(estrogen and progesterone) usually change throughout the menstrual cycle and can cause menstrual symptoms.`,

        title: 'How long is a typical menstrual cycle?',
        content: `The typical menstrual cycle is 28 days long, but each woman is different. Also, a woman's menstrual cycle length might be different from month-to-month. Your periods are still “regular” if they usually come every 24 to 38 days. This means that the time from the first day of your last period up to the start of your next period is at least 24 days but not more than 38 days.  \n             
        Some women's periods are so regular that they can predict the day and time that their periods will start. Other women are regular but can only predict the start of their period within a few days. `

export const defaultFAQs = {
    'When does a girl usually get her first period?': `
    The average age for a girl in the United States to get her first period is 12. \n
    This does not mean that all girls start at the same age. A girl may start her period anytime between 8 and 15. The first period normally starts about two years after breasts first start to develop and pubic hair begins to grow. The age at which a girl's mother started her period can help predict when a girl may start her period. \n
    `,
    'How will I know when my periods are going to start?': `
    Signs that your period is on its way are if you've grown underarm and pubic hair. Typically, you'll start your periods about 2 years after your breasts start growing and about a year after getting a white vaginal discharge. The average girl will get her first period around 12 years old, but it varies from person to person. \n
    `,
    'How do I get ready for my first period?': `
    Talk to your parent or another adult you trust about what you can expect before it actually happens. \n
    It's a good idea to start carrying sanitary pads or tampons around with you in advance. If you find yourself at school without a pad or tampon, ask a teacher or the school nurse for some. \n
    `,
    'What if period blood leaks through my clothes?': `
    Usually it's not a sudden gush - you'll just see a reddish-brown stain on your pants or on your sheets when you wake up in the morning. \n
    There are ways of covering up stains until you're able to change your clothes, such as tying a sweatshirt around your waist. Keep a spare pair of pants and tights at school or in your bag. \n
