        Period-shame is something a lot of women feel, starting with their very first cycle, which can occur as young as eight years old. Those feelings of embarrassment and self-hate are then reinforced by society, which tells women that their bodies should be clean and tidy, and if they aren't, well that's not something to be openly and honestly discussed.`,

        content: `Menstruation is one of the most natural functions in the world. It is a mark of femininity and fertility, and a huge part of life for most women. Yet, for some reason, women are frequently made to feel ashamed or embarrassed simply because they bleed, and, according to new research, this shaming often comes from those closest to them. \n       
        Women with periods are seen as “dirty” according to traditional beliefs. For example, women are not allowed to honor the dead during menstruation.`,

        content: `Chinese people have also nicknamed menstrual periods in multiple ways to avoid saying it out loud. It's often referred to as having "fallen into misfortune", "auntie", or "official holiday" in Chinese. In the poster of a popular Indian film released in China in 2018, Pad Man — in which an Indian entrepreneur invents a better and more affordable menstrual pad — translated the film's name to Indian Partner, and exchanged the pad held in the main character's hand with white paper. \n    
        The lack of sex education also contributes to the stigma around periods. A 2012 survey of 1,593 teenagers ages 14 to 17 shows that 73.5% believe that they barely receive sex education at school, while 86.6% said that they rarely get sex knowledge from their parents. Many Chinese women also still believe they can lose their virginity by using tampons — as of 2016, only 2% of women nationwide had used them.`,
