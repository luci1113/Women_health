Heriod is on a mission to fill this gap by sharing user data, carefully de-identified to protect your privacy, for the purposes of scientific and medical research about menstrual and reproductive health. De-identification means that Heriod will either delete such information from data sets that could identify you as an individual, such as your username or email address, or will replace this information with a random number, so information on your identity will not be shared with any research partner. \n
                We want to make it very clear that we personally select our scientific collaborators with the utmost care and, most importantly, that we only provide data for scientific research after it has been de-identified following a strict protocol that involves the removal or hashing of any information that could be used to identify any specific user. \n
