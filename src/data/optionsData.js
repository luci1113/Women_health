    content: `Let's face it—there is nothing cheap about period products. Those who menstruate may have an average of 450 periods over their lifetime, according to the Association of Reproductive Health Care Professionals. And with the average period lasting two to seven days, you may easily spend $1,000 (or more!) on a lifetime supply of period products. \n
    Here's what to know about the best period care products on the market—and how to decide which one may be right for your menstrual flow.`,

        title: 'Panty Liners',
        content: `Panty liners are a thin, absorbent feminine hygiene product that is worn in the gusset of a woman’s panties. They are similar to sanitary pads but less absorbent and smaller in size. Panty liners are thin and have an adhesive at their bottom that could be stuck onto your underwear. \n
        They cover a small area of your underwear and are ideal for managing period spotting, vaginal discharge, post intercourse discharge, and urinary incontinence. They can also be worn to ensure extra protection of possible leaks while using period products like a tampon or a menstrual cup.`,

        content: `The regular sanitary napkins are most commonly used to manage light to medium blood flow. They are also a lot thicker than panty liners and offer a sufficient level of absorbency. \n
        They could be worn during the day and have to be replaced every four hours or more frequently if you are experiencing a heavier flow. You can find them with wings (flaps attached to either side with an adhesive that helps you secure it in place) and without wings. However, the former is almost always preferred for added safety and comfort.`,

        content: `The extra-long pads are usually thicker than their regular counterparts. They cover most of your underwear and could make you feel a bit bulky. Consider wearing them to manage a heavy flow on days you are traveling and cannot change your sanitary pad as often as you'd like to. \n        
        They come with absorbent adhesive wings to prevent leakage for days you absolutely cannot afford to leave a stain. This pad is a perfect pick for your second day of period if you wish to put on your white pants and head out for a fun brunch party.`,

        description: `Sanitary pads—a.k.a. sanitary napkins, menstrual pads, panty liners, or pads—are the most popular type of menstrual product. Made with natural or synthetic fibers, this disposable product may be cotton or rayon. Sanitary pads also come in a variety of thicknesses, depending on your flow.`,
        pros: `You may wear a sanitary pad externally—stuck to the inside of your underwear—which is a big difference from tampons. One major benefit: you don't have to worry about getting toxic shock syndrome, which makes them a great alternative to tampons.
        If you have a heavier period, you may feel more comfortable wearing a sanitary pad—and some folks may wear one as a back-up for tampons on heavier period days. Sanitary pads may also be a good option if tampons may cause irritation or dryness.`,
        cons: `One of the biggest downsides of sanitary pads is the ongoing expense. A box of sanitary pads may cost between $6 to $10, depending on the number of pads and absorbency. You may have to replace your sanitary pad every few hours—which, like tampons, creates a lot of waste.`,

        description: `Made of cotton, rayon, or a blend of the two, tampons are disposable products with a cylindrical shape. You may insert tampons into your vagina with a cardboard or plastic applicator—or by using your fingers.
        There is a range of tampons on the market—including light to heavy flow—or scented and unscented options. You may also buy tampons made from organic cotton.`,
        pros: `If your body tolerates tampons well, you won't be able to feel them. You can take part in normal activities while wearing on, like swimming or team sports, and tampons are easy and convenient to transport.`,
        cons:`The biggest downside of tampons is the potential for toxic shock syndrome, which has the potential to be life-threatening. But you may avoid trouble with less absorbent tampons—and by changing them more frequently. According to the Food and Drug Administration, you should change your tampon every four to eight hours.        
        Another downside of tampons is the high ongoing expense. A box of tampons may cost between $6 to $13 per box—and depending on your flow, the product may create a significant amount of waste every month.`,

        description: `If you're looking for ways to save money and to create less waste, you may want to try a menstrual cup. So, what is a menstrual cup? Made of silicone, latex, rubber, or elastomer—menstrual cups may be reusable—and come in a variety of sizes.`,
        pros: `The biggest advantage of a reusable menstrual cup is it may last for up to ten years. You can wear a menstrual cup for up to twelve hours—and it won't stop you from any normal activities.`,
        cons: `One major downside of these new period products is the initial cost. While you may spend less money over time, there's a bigger upfront expense. You should expect to spend anywhere from $25 to $40. Another negative is menstrual cups may offer less protection—and it may not be enough for those with a heavier flow.`,
